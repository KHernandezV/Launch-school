input : string
output : all possible 2 character or longer combinations which are equal when reversed

define method
create array to store palindromes
use times method to iterate through 0 to input length -1
  every 2 character or longer combination starting from iterator position to input length
    check if character combination is equal to character combination reversed
      if so, push to array storing palindromes
return array
