sum of 2 integers

ask the user for the first integer
ask the user for the second integer
print the addition of the two integers


START

GET integer 1
GET integer 2

PRINT integer 1 + integer 2

END



return concatenated array of strings

create the array of strings
loop to concatenate the strings
print the concatenated string


START

SET array
SET concatenated array store
WHILE iterator < array length
	iterator of array added to concatenated array store
PRINT concatenated array store

END 



return every other element of array

create the array to take from
create the array to put into
loop to choose every other array
return array to put into


START

SET array with nums
SET return array
WHILE iterator < length of array with nums
	IF iterator modulo 2 is 0 push iterator of array to return array
	ELSE skip iteration
PRINT return array

END



return index of third occurrence of a character

create string
create character to look for
create counter to keep track of character occurrence
loop to find character in string
once character has been found for the third time return current index
if character is not found 3 times return nil

START

SET string
SET character
SET counter
WHILE iterator < string length
	IF character equals iterator of string add 1 to counter
	IF counter is 3 return index
	IF end of iterations is reached and counter isn't 3 return nil

END



return alternatively merged arrays

START

SET first array
SET second array
SET return array

WHILE iterator < array length doubled
	IF iterator is even unshift from first array into return array
	ELSE unshift from second array into return array
PRINT return array

END
