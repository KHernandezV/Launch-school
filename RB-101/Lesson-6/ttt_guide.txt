Tic Tac Toe Logic

Game begins with an empty board, consisting of a 3x3 board (resembling the pound sign). 
The players will alternate entering symbols into the 3x3 board, with the objective of:
  1. Entering 3 symbols consecutively either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
  2. Stopping the other player from accomplishing objective 1.
  3. If objective 1 is ever accomplished, the game should be considered finished, and whomever accomplished objective 1 declared winner.
If after 9 moves(where the board would be full), the game remains without either player accomplishing goal one, the game is considered a draw.
Conventions:
  1. after a game the player with the first move is alternated.
  2. the markings used by the players are generally the letter "X" and a circle.
